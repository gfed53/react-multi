# Routing with React and Meteor


## Description

This project was created for me to gain experience working with ReactJS, Meteor. I needed to create a website that had different data broken down by time period and category.

This is a simple example of the structure of the site. The data is stored in JSON format, and is broken down by pages, and each page is broken down by different platforms. Essentially, there is a route for every platform for each specific page.

Some of the main technologies used:
* ReactJS
* Meteor
* kadira:flow-router
* react-mounter

## For the Future

I may want to experiment with CMS-like functionality, allowing admin users to insert their own content from the view, and have all data saved to MongoDB. 

I'm also experimenting with React transitions since I want to be able to achieve a fade-in-out effect when navigating from route-to-route.
