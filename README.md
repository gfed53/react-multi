# Routing with React and Meteor


## Description

This project was created for me to gain experience working with ReactJS and Meteor. I needed to create a website that had different data broken down by time period and category.

This is a simple example of the structure of the site. The data is stored in JSON format, and is broken down by pages, and each page is broken down by different platforms. Essentially, there is a route for every platform for each specific page.

Some of the main technologies used:
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
* [kadira:flow-router](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router)
* [react-mounter](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-mounter)

## For the Future

I will most likely be using this repo to experiment with features I want to integrate with this stack (for any potential projects).

...some of which are:
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (both used within Meteor and outside of it, in a separate backend.)
* [mLab](https://mlab.com)
* CMS-like functionality, using libraries such as [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/).
* React transitions, using libraries like [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).
